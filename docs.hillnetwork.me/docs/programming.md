## Overview
My computer science courses focused largely on programming. Unfortunately, the number of languages they teach is quite small, but I was able to learn many of them on my own. I focused more on scripting languages than "programming" languages since they're more geared towards what I'm hoping to do in the future.


## Python 
This is my strongest language. I've used it for a number of tasks, including automating my job. I used python for my compiler class as well. 

## Bash
This is definitely purely a scripting language, but I figured it's important to note. I've focused on using the command line for several years, and have create a number of scripts for various tasks. Some of these scripts can be found on my [github](https://github.com/hillnicholas).

## Java
This is what we've used the most in school. I've implented linked lists, hashmaps, binary search trees and parsers for my courses. We've also implemented several projects in java for school, including a subset of features in a relational database and a voting system.

## C
This one is tricky. We used C in a unix-like environment, so we've used a lot of features given to us by the kernel. We've also used C in our operating systems course, where we had to implement almost everything from scratch. While I have a strong understanding of the syntax and pointers in C, I'm still unfamilliar with many of the common libraries.
