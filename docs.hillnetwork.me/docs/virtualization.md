## Overview
Over the last several years, I have been able to develop a working knowledge for a number of hypervisors and system containers, including:
* Linux KVM
* LXD
* VMware ESXi
* Oracle Virtualbox

I have focused mostly on KVM during the last several months but can work comfortably with the others through graphical management interfaces.

## KVM
I use KVM frequently for testing projects and concepts that require full access to privileged system resources. I will also be using it to provide the compute service (Nova) for my most recent Openstack deployment.

## LXD
I use LXD much more frequently on my desktop for testing and developing projects since it requires less resources. My two big servers are currently being used for an Openstack build, so I'm not currently using their resources for other test/dev environments. 

## VMware ESXi
My experience with VMware has been solely with using the vSphere web console available with releases 6.5 and up. I am also using VMware ESXi for my most recent cloud project. 

## Oracle Virtualbox
I used to use virtualbox much more before. I always found it to be a great tool to have on any desktop to run different operating systems when needed. As I moved more towards learning enterprise virtualization technology, my personal use of virtualbox has decreased. I still use Virtualbox frequently for my job with infosec at WVU to investigate malicious links and attachments.
