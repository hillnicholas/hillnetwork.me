### Project Documentation Page
An in-depth description of my work projects, personal projects, and overall experience can be found [here](https://projects.hillnetwork.me).
  

### Github
You can find some of the scripts I've made on my github [here](https://github.com/hillnicholas). My goal for this summer is to get involved in some open source projects, particularly Openstack. As I begin contributing more open source code, I'll begin to add it to this page.
