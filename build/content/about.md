### About Me
I'm currently a senior studying computer science at West Virginia University on track to graduate in the Fall of 2018. I've been working with the information security team at the school for almost 2 years now. Between school, my job, and what I've been building in my own time, I've developed a well-rounded knowledge in a number of areas of information technology. 


### Non-Technical Interests
I really enjoy music (who doesn't?). I can't say I have a favorite band because that changes on a monthly basis, but I enjoy bluegrassy/jam band type music. I also really enjoy the outdoors. I can't really pick a place that I would call my favorite, but I like the desert the most. I was also once an avid rock climber. I've been out of practice for the last several months trying to learn as much technology as I can. After graduation, I hope to continue rock climbing again.

### Technical Interests 
I really enjoy studying, reading and using linux systems. I've been using linux exclusively on almost all my devices for the last 2 years now. I also have a strange interest in networking- most people I meet hate it. If I need to connect to the internet, [I will always find a way.](/ios-tethering)


### Professional Goals
I want to succeed in my career. I've learned recently that finding openings in this field can be very competitive. I'm hoping to get involved in projects that not only benefit a single company, but people in general. I also hope to contribute code to the mainline Linux kernel.
