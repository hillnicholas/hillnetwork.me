### Project Documentation Page
An in-depth description of my work projects, personal projects, and overall experience can be found [here](https://docs.hillnetwork.me).
  

### Github
You can find some of the scripts I've made on my github [here](https://github.com/hillnicholas). My goal for this summer is to get involved in open source projects. As I begin contributing more open source code, I'll begin to add it to this page.

### Current projects

* [easyswan](https://github.com/hillnicholas/easyswan): Strongswan auto-configuration script for simple roadwarrior tunneling connections.

* [PyNessus](https://github.com/hillnicholas/pyNessus): A python API wrapper for automating some Nessus scanner tasks.

* [SecurityCenterScripts](https://github.com/hillnicholas/SecurityCenterScripts): A series of checker scripts implemented as plugins to help locate various common configuration/data entry errors. Also includes a log pulling tool.
