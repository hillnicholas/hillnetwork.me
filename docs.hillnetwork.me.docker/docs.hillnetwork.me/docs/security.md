# Overview
I've had a job in infosec with WVU for almost 2 years now. When I first started, I really didn't know very much about what I was doing. I've since learned a ton about vulnerability management, current security threats, and infrastructure. 

### Nessus 
I have a significant amount of experience with Nessus. This is the software we used to perform scans across the University Computers. I created an API wrapper that can interact with Nessus scanners, which can be found here: [https://github.com/hillnicholas/pyNessus](https://github.com/hillnicholas/pyNessus)

## SecurityCenter
One of my duties with infosec was performing systems administration tasks and data entry on our SecurityCenter instance. I was able to master it's use. I also *almost* fully automated all of the data entry for required to keep SecurityCenter up to date. More information this project can be found in [this document](/documents/securitycenter_automation.pdf).
