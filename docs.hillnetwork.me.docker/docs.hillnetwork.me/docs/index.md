I have decided to create a full documentation site to discuss my technical knowledge, projects, and overall character. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at nick@hillnetwork.me.

## About Me

<!--img src="img/picofme.jpg" width="100px"-->
I'm currently a senior attending West Virginia University on track to graduate with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science in the Fall of 2018. Between my schoolwork, my professional work, and my personal projects, I have been able to build a well-rounded functional knowledge in a number of areas of information technology.
