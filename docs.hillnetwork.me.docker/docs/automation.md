I have some background with automation. 

## SecurityCenter Data Entry Automation
My primary job with infosec was data entry for our SecurityCenter instance. It was difficult to automate because the data I was recieving to put into the system was nothing like what the system accepted. There were several edge cases that needed to be accounted for. There were also bugs with SecurityCenter itself that needed to be watched. Additionally, this was a production system, so any failures or inaccurate data being fed into the system would show immediately. The following PDF describes the project in more depth: [SecurityCenterAutomation.pdf](documents/SecurityCenterAutomation.pdf)
